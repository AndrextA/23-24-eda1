# Project Overview - Nutrimet / Patient Survey System

This project is a console-based Java application that allows a patient to fill out a survey about their food intake over a period of five days. The application provides an interactive menu for the user to fill out the survey for a specific day, display the current structure of the survey, or exit the program.

## Class Descriptions
`Main`: This is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the SurveySystem class and starts the execution.

## How to Run
